 			<p><strong>Refund and Cancellation</strong></p>
			<p>We provide an extensive portfolio for you to view before hiring us for your project so you can see the quality level of our work and be completely comfortable working with us. If you have any questions or reservations, please contact us prior to making a payment for our services. Thank you!</p>

			<p><strong>Web Design</strong></p>
			<p>Payments for custom design projects are made to us in increments as a courtesy to the client. Once a payment or deposit is made, it is non-refundable. If a project is canceled or postponed, all monies paid are retained by eLuminous Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and if applicable, a fee for all work completed beyond what was already paid for shall be paid by the client.</p>

			<p><strong>Refund</strong></p>
			<p>If we receive a chargeback or payment dispute (i.e. PayPal Dispute) from a credit card company or bank, your service and/or project will be suspended without notice. A $50 chargeback fee (issued to recover fees passed on to us by the credit company), plus any outstanding balances accrued as a result of the chargeback(s) must be paid in full before service is restored, files delivered, or any further work is done. <br> <br>Instead of issuing a chargeback, contact us to address any billing issues. Requesting a chargeback or opening a PayPal dispute for a valid charge from us is fraud, and is never an appropriate or legal means of obtaining a refund.<br> Please read and make sure you fully understand our refund policy prior to making a payment.</p>

			<p>We, at eLuminous, believes in helping all customers as far as possible and has consequently prepared a thoughtful refund and cancellation policy. There may be some case of customer dissatisfaction due to many reasons. In case of dissatisfaction from our services eLuminous may create a committee to and will decide on a refund to the client or not.</p>
